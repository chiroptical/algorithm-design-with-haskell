Here lies the code for "Algorithm Design with Haskell" by Richard Bird and
Jeremy Gibbons. You can find the book on
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Haskell-Richard-Bird/dp/1108491618).
I receive no financial benefit.

The code is written in Unison. You can download Unison from [their
website](https://www.unisonweb.org/docs/quickstart#step-1-install-unison).
