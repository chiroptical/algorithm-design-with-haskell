Here lies the code for "Algorithm Design with Haskell" by Richard Bird and
Jeremy Gibbons. You can find the book on
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Haskell-Richard-Bird/dp/1108491618).
I receive no financial benefit.

Each folder, e.g. `chapter1/` contains a stack project with the code written
during the chapter.  Stack can be found
[here](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install)
